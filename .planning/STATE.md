# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08)

**Core value:** Emission calculations must be correct and reproducible across all activity types and all three scenarios, and the codebase must be safe to change without silently regressing those numbers.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - CI Test Gate & Production Config Guard

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (CI Test Gate & Production Config Guard)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-08 - Roadmap created (4 phases, 17 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: n/a
- Trend: n/a

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: CI gate (Phase 1) sequenced first; every later phase depends on a trustworthy gate running against real Postgres.
- Roadmap: Golden files plus fail-fast validation (Phase 2) precede the calculators.py decomposition (Phase 3) so the refactor has a regression net.
- Roadmap: PERF-01 N+1 fixes and PERF-02 IPCC caching grouped with auth hardening (Phase 4), after golden coverage exists to catch data-shape regressions.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 (from research): confirm APP_MODE=test and .env.test loading in CI so migrations run against the test DB, not a fallback SQLite.
- Phase 4 (from research): confirm App Engine worker count, autoscaling, Memorystore/Redis availability, and DRF NUM_PROXIES before wiring shared-cache rate limiting.
